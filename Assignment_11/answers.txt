Hop 1 and 2 (10.1.0.2 and 192.168.253.252):

These are your local network devices (routers or gateway). The low times (2-21 ms) indicate they're close to you (within your local network).
Hops 3-30 (Request timed out):

From hop 3 onward, there is a timeout for each request. This means the routers in the path are not responding to your tracert requests (ICMP packets).
Why it happens: Many routers or firewalls block ICMP requests for security reasons, or they might be configured not to respond to tracert probes.
What it means: The path to the destination (iiitg.ac.in) is still operational; the packets are likely still reaching the destination, but the intermediate routers aren't responding to tracert.

Yes, there is a difference.

Before pinging 10.1.0.100, it was not in your ARP cache. After pinging, the entry for 10.1.0.100 appeared in the cache with its MAC address.

Why?
Your computer learned the MAC address of 10.1.0.100 through an ARP request-response during the ping, and added it to the cache for future communication.
